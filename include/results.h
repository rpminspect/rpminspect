/* emptyrpm */
#define REMEDY_EMPTYRPM _("Check to see if you eliminated a subpackage but still have the %%package and/or the %%files section for it.")

/* license */
#define REMEDY_LICENSE _("The License tag must contain an approved license string as defined by the distribution (e.g., GPLv2+).  If the license in question is approved, the license database needs updating in the rpminspect-data package.")
#define REMEDY_LICENSEDB _("Make sure the licensedb setting in the rpminspect.conf file is set to a valid licensedb file.  This is also commonly due to a missing vendor specific rpminspect-data package on the system.")
#define REMEDY_UNAPPROVED_LICENSE _("The specified license abbreviation is not listed as approved in the license database.  The license database is specified in the rpminspect.conf file.  Check this file and send a pull request to the appropriate upstream project to update the database.  If the license is listed in the database but marked unapproved, you may need to work with the legal team regarding options for this software.")

/* elf */
#define REMEDY_ELF_TEXTREL _("Ensure all object files are compiled with -fPIC")
#define REMEDY_ELF_EXECSTACK_MISSING _("Ensure that the package is being built with the correct compiler and compiler flags")

#define REMEDY_ELF_EXECSTACK_EXECUTABLE _("An ELF stack is marked as executable. Ensure that no execstack options are being passed to the linker, and that no functions are defined on the stack.")
#define REMEDY_ELF_GNU_RELRO _("Ensure executables are linked with with '-z relro -z now'")
#define REMEDY_ELF_FORTIFY_SOURCE _("Ensure all object files are compiled with '-O2 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2', and that all appropriate headers are included (no implicit function declarations). Symbols may also appear as unfortified if the compiler is unable to determine the size of a buffer, which is not necessarily an error.")
#define REMEDY_ELF_FPIC _("Ensure all object files are compiled with -fPIC")
#define REMEDY_ELF_IPV6 _("Please review all usages of IPv4-only functions and ensure IPv6 compliance.")

/* man */
#define REMEDY_MAN_ERRORS _("Correct the errors in the man page as reported by the libmandoc parser.")

/* addedfiles */
#define REMEDY_ADDEDFILES _("Unexpected file additions were found.  Verify these changes are correct.  If they are not, adjust the build to prevent the file additions.")

/* upstream */
#define REMEDY_UPSTREAM _("Unexpected changed source archive content.  The version of the package did not change between builds, but the source archive content did.  This may be deliberate, but needs inspection.")

/* ownership */
#define REMEDY_OWNERSHIP_DEFATTR _("Make sure the %%files section includes the %%defattr macro.")
#define REMEDY_OWNERSHIP_BIN_OWNER _("Bin path files must be owned by the bin_owner set in rpminspect.conf, which is usually root.")

#define REMEDY_SHELLSYNTAX_GAINED_SHELL _("The file referenced was not a known shell script in the before build but is now a shell script in the after build.")
#define REMEDY_SHELLSYNTAX_BAD _("The referenced shell script is invalid. Consider debugging it with the '-n' option on the shell to find and fix the problem.")

/* annocheck */
#define REMEDY_ANNOCHECK _("See annocheck(1) for more information.")

/* DT_NEEDED */
#define REMEDY_DT_NEEDED _("DT_NEEDED symbols have been added or removed.  This happens when the build environment has different versions of the required libraries.  Sometimes this is deliberate but sometimes not.  Verify these changes are expected.  If they are not, modify the package spec file to ensure the build links with the correct shared libraries.")

/* filesize */
#define REMEDY_FILESIZE_BECAME_NOT_EMPTY _("A previously empty file is no longer empty.  Make sure this change is intended and fix the package spec file if necessary.")
#define REMEDY_FILESIZE_BECAME_EMPTY _("A previously non-empty file is now empty.  Make sure this change is intended and fix the package space file if necessary.")

/* capabilities */
#define REMEDY_CAPABILITIES _("Unexpected capabilities were found on the indicated file.  Consult capabilities(7) and either adjust the files in the package or modify the capabilities whitelist file in the rpminspect vendor data package.  The security team may also be of help for this situation.")

/* kmod */
#define REMEDY_KMOD_PARM _("Kernel module parameters were removed between builds.  This may present usability problems for users if module parameters were removed in a maintenance update.")
#define REMEDY_KMOD_DEPS _("Kernel module dependencies changed between builds.  This may present usability problems for users if module dependencies changed in a maintenance update.")

#define REMEDY_SUBPACKAGES_GAIN _("A new subpackage has appeared in the after build.  This may indicate progress in the world of computing.")

/* changelog */
#define REMEDY_CHANGELOG _("Make sure the spec file in the after build contains a valid %changelog section.")

/* pathmigration */
#define REMEDY_PATHMIGRATION _("Files should not be installed in old directory names.  Modify the package to install the affected file to the preferred directory.")

/* lto */
#define REMEDY_LTO _("ELF .o and .a files should not carry LTO (Link Time Optimization) bytecode.  Make sure you have stripped LTO bytecode from those files at install time.")

/* symlinks */
#define REMEDY_SYMLINKS _("Make sure symlinks point to a valid destination in one of the subpackages of the build; dangling symlinks are not allowed.  If you are comparing builds and have a non-symlink turn in to a symlink, ensure this is deliberate.  NOTE:  You cannot turn a directory in to a symlink due to RPM limitations.");
#define REMEDY_SYMLINKS_DIRECTORY _("Make sure symlinks point to a valid destination in one of the subpackages of the build; dangling symlinks are not allowed.  If you are comparing builds and have a non-symlink turn in to a symlink, ensure this is deliberate.  NOTE:  You cannot turn a directory in to a symlink due to RPM limitations.  If you absolutely must do that, make sure you include the %%pretrans scriptlet for replacing a directory.  See the packaging guidelines for 'Scriptlet to replace a directory' for more information.");
