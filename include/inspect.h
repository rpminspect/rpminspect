If the package is a rebase and not on the rebaseable list and the rebase inspection is enabled, ABI differences are reported as failures.  The assumption here is that rpminspect is comparing builds for maintenance purposes and you do not want to introduce any ABI changes for users.

If thresholds are reached regarding a change in the patch size or the number of files the patch touches, rpminspect reports the change at the VERIFY level unless the comparison is for a rebase.  The configuration file can also list patch names that rpminspect should ignore during the inspection.")
