# WHAT IS THIS:
# This script parses /usr/include/elf.h to generate a C function that,
# given a ELF relocation entry, determines whether that relocation indicates
# that the ELF object is compiled to use position independent code.

# THAT SOUNDS REALLY AWFUL:
# Yeah it kind of does. The problem is that the only way we know to determine
# whether a .o file was compiled with -fPIC or not is to look for relocations
# that either use a procedure linkage table (PLT) or global offset table (GOT),
# and the values for these relocation types are all architecture specific.
# Some alternatives are:
#  * do it the old way: run `eu-readelf --reloc` and grep for
#    (PLT|GOT) in the reloc type: The disadvantage is that you need
#    run eu-readelf and parse its output a whole bunch of times.
#  * write a function that hard-codes all of the relevant
#    architectures and relocation types: That's basically what this
#    script is doing. Writing it by hand(ish) would have the advantage
#    that no bad symbols slip through, but that assumes that the
#    writer actually knows what any of this stuff means. This would
#    also means the function has to be manually updated every time a
#    new arch comes along.
#  * find someone who knows what any of this stuff means to explain a
#    better way: Maybe?
#
# Anyway here goes. The machine types are in the EM_<arch> #define's, and the
# reloc types are in the R_<arch>_<type> #define's. The only case we (sort of)
# care about where the arch's don't match is ia64: it's EM_IA_64 but R_IA64_*.
