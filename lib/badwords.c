/**
 * @brief Check the given string for any defined bad words, return
 * true if found.
 *
 * Given a list of bad words, check the specified string for any of
 * those bad words and return true on a match.  The search is
 * conducted with **strcasestr(3)** as well as checking for a preceeding
 * space to ensure it avoids substrings in the middle of a word.  For
 * example, if the badwords list contains `flag' then this function
 * will match ` flag' and ` flagging' but not ` conflagration'.  If
 * the list of bad words provided is empty, the function returns
 * false.
 *
 * @param s NUL-terminated string to scan for bad words.
 * @param badwords List of bad words to look for.
 * @return True if a bad word was found in the string, false otherwise.
