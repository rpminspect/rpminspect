= libxdiff-1.0 =

This is a merged libxdiff taken from the forks in git and libgit2. 
Because bundling is stupid.

It probably isn't compatible with anything that wants the old crufty libxdiff 
(0.23), but it should work as a shared lib for git and libgit2 to use.

This code is LGPLv2+, all copyrights belong to the respective git & libgit2 
folks.
