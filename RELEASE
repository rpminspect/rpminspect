Release Checklist

[ ] Ensure all required PRs are merged and all GitHub Actions pass.
    Fix any issues that break CI.  The main branch should build
    cleanly on all CI targets and the test suite should pass
    everywhere.

Use the upstream release repo for these steps:

[ ] git clean -dxf

[ ] git pull

[ ] make

[ ] make check

[ ] make clean

[ ] make announce > ~/newchanges

[ ] Edit CHANGES.md and create a new entry for the upcoming release
    with the heading "Changes in rpminspect-X.Y".  Paste the contents
    of ~/newchanges in this section.

[ ] git add CHANGES.md && git commit -s -m "Update CHANGES.md"

[ ] make authors

[ ] git add AUTHORS.md && git commit -s -m "Update AUTHORS.md"

[ ] make update-pot

[ ] git add po && git commit -s -m "Update translation template"

[ ] git push

[ ] make clean

[ ] make release

[ ] make srpm

[ ] Go to https://github.com/rpminspect/rpminspect and draft a new
    release for this release.  Title it "rpminspect-X.Y" and paste the
    contents of 'newchanges' in the description box.  Attach these
    files to the release from this directory:

        rpminspect-X.Y.tar.gz
        rpminspect-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

[ ] make koji

    NOTE: You may want to try each branch individually using the
    syntax described in the 'make help' output.  By default this
    target will submit Koji builds for all Fedora and EPEL branches in
    the rpminspect dist-git repo that have active build targets.

[ ] Wait for the builds to finish.  You will receive email
    notifications or you can watch the progress in the Koji task URL.
    For each branch that completes (except rawhide), submit an update
    request for that build:

        fedpkg switch-branch BRANCH
        git clean -dxf
        git pull
        fedpkg update --type enhancement --request testing \
                      --notes "Upgrade to rpminspect-X.Y" \
                      --no-require-bugs --no-require-testcases

    The type can be 'bugfix', 'security', 'enhancement', or
    'newpackage'.  Generally rpminspect will be enhancement unless the
    release only contains bug fixes.  If there's a new inspection or
    significant change, mark it as an enhancement.

[ ] In the master branch, increment the version number of the project
    in meson.build and push that.  This way the new Copr builds will
    carry a newer version number that represents the next release.

[ ] git push

The release is now done.  Use the text from ~/newchanges in a blog
post about the release.  It may be a good idea to go do releases of
the data packages now and do a combined blog post about all of them.
