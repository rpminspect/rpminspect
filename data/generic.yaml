#products:
    # Product release string matches.  rpminspect uses product release
    # strings to determine what metadata files to use from the
    # rpminspect-data package.  By default, rpminspect tries to figure
    # out the product by extracting the dist tag portion of the
    # Release tag in the RPM.  If you are comparing two builds, the
    # product release string needs to match.  If they do not match,
    # you have two options:
    #
    # 1) Specify the "-r" option and give rpminspect a product release
    #    string.
    # 2) Rely on the product release string regexps in rpminspect.yaml
    #
    # Some products may have a variety of dist tags, so you can
    # construct a regular expression (man 7 regex) to match them.  For
    # example, let's say your dist tags are ".fc31, .fc31server,
    # .fc31laptop".  You want to use "fc31" for all of these, so you
    # can add a rule here that looks like:
    #
    #     - fc31: ^\.fc31.*$
    #
    # And rpminspect will match the longer ones to fc31.  By default
    # there is no product release regexp mapping enabled.
    #- fc31: ^\.fc31.*$

macrofiles:

modularity:
    # This block only applies to RPM-based modules, something you will

    # additional metadata.  For more information, see:
    #
    # https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/
    #
    # rpminspect can check RPMs that are part of a module since module
    # builds can come from Koji.

    # Should modules carry a "static_context: true" setting?  The
    # possible options that rpminspect can check and report on are:
    #
    #     required     RPMs in modules must have setting
    #     forbidden    RPMs in modules must not have the setting
    #     recommend    RPMs do not need it, but if missing then rpminspect
