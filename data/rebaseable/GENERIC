# List of rebaseable packages.  This file lists package names that
# should not have a version number check performed.  That is, we are
# ok with always rebasing these packages.  The version number check is
# meant to flag packages that have been rebased for verification, but
# some packages are provided by the distributor and rebasing is
# standard practice during development.
#
# One package name per line.  Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.
# Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
#
# Example (commented out):
#firefox
