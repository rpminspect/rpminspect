# This is the ABI checking control file.  rpminspect uses this information
# to perform ABI compatibility tests.  The file is divided in to sections
# as follows:
#
# [level X]
# package={list_of_dsos|"all-dsos"}
#
# First the levels.  There are four levels available for ABI compatibility
# testing:
#     level 1       Symbol mismatches are considered a failure
#     level 2       Symbol mismatches are noted, but can be waived
#     level >=3     Symbol mismatches are reported as informational
#     level none    Explicitly note packages to not run the ABI check on
#
# This file has sections for each level desired.  Under each section are
# lines that are a package name, an equal sign, then a list of DSOs to
# check or the keyword "all-dsos".  For example:
#
#     glibc=all-dsos
#     zlib=libz.so.1
#
# All DSOs in the glibc package would be examined while only the libz.so.1
# DSO from the zlib package would be examined.  Explicit paths are not
# required, but can be used to further refine the check.
#
# Full example (commented out):
#
#[level 1]
#glibc=all-dsos
#
#[level 2]
#openssl=all-dsos
#
#[level 3]
#gtk3=all-dsos
#
# In practice, you likely want to use "all-dsos" for nearly every package.
# Exceptions are instances where a .so is shipped with a package, but is
# entirely internal to the package itself.
