| rpminspect and librpminspect |
+==============================+

The tests below are the categories handled by rpmdiff-checker, which
is the ancestor to rpminspect.  Red Hat associates may recognize these
as the grid categories on the rpmdiff webui.  Each test category may
perform a couple of tests.  As tests are documented and implemented,
the specifics will be noted during the work in progress.

* indicates the logic for the tests has moved to librpminspect
! means the work is in-progress


Unranked tests categories to migrate (might also decide to skip them):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 TEST_SCRIPT
 TEST_STRIP
 TEST_TRIGGERS


Other:
    - Check for presence of required external program in abidiff,
      kmidiff, and other functions that fork and exec another program.

    - Add a 'rebase' inspection that just fails if packages are being
      rebased but not on the rebaseable list.  This should be off by
      default but then enabled in a maintenance profile.  Maybe???


Test categories that have been migrated:
----------------------------------------
*TEST_CHANGED (changedfiles)
*TEST_DESKTOP (desktop)
*TEST_EMPTYRPM (emptyrpm)
*TEST_FILELIST (addedfiles and removedfiles)
*TEST_JAVABYTECODE (javabytecode)
*TEST_MANPAGE (manpage)
*TEST_OWNERSHIP (ownership)
*TEST_SHELLSYNTAX (shellsyntax)
*TEST_XML (xml)
*TEST_IPV6 (part of elf inspection in rpminspect)
*TEST_EXECSHIELD (elf)
*TEST_NEEDED (DT_NEEDED)
*TEST_UPSTREAM (upstream; the BZ 'Rebase' keyword check against the
                Errata Tool bug list was not migrated, see below)
*TEST_PERMS (permissions and capabilities)
*TEST_MODPARM (kmod)
*TEST_MODPCIID (kmod)
*TEST_RPMCHANGE (arch and subpackages)
*TEST_CHANGELOG (changelog)
*TEST_PATHNAMES (pathmigration; the forbidden init paths are added
                 to forbidden_path_prefixes in the config file and
                 those are caught by 'addedfiles')
*TEST_SIZE (filesize)
*TEST_SYMLINK (symlinks)
*TEST_SPECFILE (disttag, license, and files)
*TEST_TYPES (types)
*TEST_FILEMOVE (movedfiles)
*TEST_ABI (abidiff and kmidiff)
*TEST_CONFIG (config and doc)
*TEST_PATCHES (patches)
*TEST_VIRUS (virus)
*TEST_POLITICS (politics)
*TEST_RPATH (runpath)
*TEST_METADATA (only checks for bad words, valid license, valid vendor,
                and valid buildhost)
*TEST_REQUIRES (rpmdeps)


Test categories excluded (see MISSING):
---------------------------------------
 TEST_BUILDLOG
 TEST_RPMLINT
 TEST_UPSTREAM (only the rebase keyword check)
 TEST_ELFLINT
 TEST_MULTILIB
 TEST_SPECFILE (only the 32-bit x86 $RPM_OPT_FLAGS check)
 TEST_METADATA (the 'fedora without red hat' string check)

Integration tests to write for rpminspect
-----------------------------------------

The test suite needs more integration tests written.  The following
inspections lack integration tests:

    modularity
    javabytecode
    changedfiles (compare only)
    removedfiles (compare only)
    addedfiles (compare only)
    annocheck
    DT_NEEDED
    capabilities
    arch
    subpackages
    pathmigration
    abidiff
    kmidiff

Need unit tests for run_cmd() verifying NULL as the last parameter.

General functionality
---------------------

* In the [inspections] section in config files, all for "ALL = on"
  and "ALL = off" to toggle everything.  Similar to the command
  line option.

* Add verbose runtime reporting.  This is currently only available
  for downloading packages.  Need to figure out how to separate it
  from the test results.

* Text mode reporting formatting.  Allow a user-specified column width
  and align output on columns.

* Migrate to a TOML config file format--or a config file format that
  looks similar to something you would see in /etc but that we have
  our own parser for.  YAML is not ideal.  Though support for YAML
  must remain as it is already established and supported.  It would be
  nice to move the defaults over to not YAML.

* Drop the need to fork/exec msgunfmt and just read in the po files
  directly.  This should be possible and will give us the information
  necessary for comparison purposes.

* Drop the need to fork/exec desktop-file-validate if a library
  mechanism can be found instead.


Documentation
-------------

Developer guide
Testing guide
User guide
    Use Doxygen for the C source but tie that in with Sphinx so
    publishing can be done on readthedocs.io

Also rpminspect.yaml.5 documenting the configuration file and the
profile configuration files.
