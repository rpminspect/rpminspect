# that contain overrides for the settings in rpminspect.conf (except

# in this list.  If it is, it performs a -n check on the script
# and if that returns non-zero, it gets reported out.
# NOTE: Each shell listed must be listed by basename only and must
# support the '-n' option for syntax checking.

[specname]
# Spec filename test matching type.
# The spec filename should match the %{name} defined in the spec file.
# For example.  If the spec file sets "Name: someprogram" then the
# spec file should be named "someprogram.spec".  There are cases where
# the spec file may vary slightly from that, so you can set the match
# type here.  It can be 'prefix', 'full', or 'suffix'.  Here are some
# examples using the someprogram example above:
#
#     %{name}          specname           Match Type     Passes?
#     someprogram      someprogram.spec   full           yes
#     someprogram      some_program.spec  full           no
#     my-someprogram   someprogram.spec   full           no
#     my-someprogram   someprogram.spec   prefix         no
#     my-someprogram   someprogram.spec   suffix         yes
#     someprogram-opt  someprogram.spec   prefix         yes
#
# By default this inspection uses 'full' matching.

# will skip the annocheck inspection.

# Minimum major JVM version number for each product release.  The key
# should be the product release string that you will use consistently
# throughout the run of rpminspect (e.g., a dist tag for Fedora).  The
# value is the JVM major version.  For example:
#     fc30 = 53
# You should also always specify a default, like this:
#     default = 53
# If the product release string is not found, the javabytecode test will
# use the default entry.  You can have as many entries as you want in
# this section.
[javabytecode]
default = 53

# Product release string matches.  rpminspect uses product release strings
# to determine what metadata files to use from the rpminspect-data package.
# By default, rpminspect tries to figure out the product by extracting the
# dist tag portion of the Release tag in the RPM.  If you are comparing two
# builds, the product release string needs to match.  If they do not match,
# you have two options:
#
#     1) Specify the "-r" option and give rpminspect a product release string.
#     2) Rely on the product release string regexps in rpminspect.conf
#
# Some products may have a variety of dist tags, so you can construct a
# regular expression to match them.  For example, let's say your dist tags
# are ".fc31, .fc31server, .fc31laptop".  You want to use "fc31" for all of
# these, so you can add a rule here that looks like:
#
#     fc31 = ^\.fc31.*$
#
# And rpminspect will match the longer ones to fc31.  By default there is no
# product release regexp mapping enabled.
#[products]
#fc31 = ^\.fc31.*$
