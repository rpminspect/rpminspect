# string data, such as the license tag and package description.  Please
# only list individual words and not phrases as the test is meant to
# capture substrings for instances where some care needs to be taken for
# phrasing or name abbreviations.
#
# Separate words by whitespace and keep the value of this setting as a
# single string.

# A missing or empty exclude key indicates that no paths should be excluded.

# You should also always specify a default, like this:
